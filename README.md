# Unofficial Trader Joe’s Price Trends with SQL Window Functions

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of *unofficial* Trader Joe’s pricing data using SQL window functions for advanced trend detection and statistical insights.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the practical application of SQL window functions to real-world data. Using commands such as `OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `LAG`, and `LEAD`, the analysis reveals trends, anomalies, and pricing patterns within unofficial Trader Joe’s data.

## Why This Project Matters

Understanding the fluctuations in Trader Joe’s prices—even unofficially—can offer practical insights into market behavior, promotional patterns, and consumer-friendly pricing strategies. Window functions enable analysts to uncover nuanced trends like:

- Fast-moving price changes (e.g., promotions or markdowns)  
- Rolling average comparisons (week-over-week or month-over-month)  
- Item-level trend deviations and volatility
