# Unofficial Trader Joe’s Price Trends with SQL Window Functions

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of *unofficial* Trader Joe’s pricing data using SQL window functions for advanced trend detection and statistical insights.

- **Data source**: Price records are collected unofficially (publicly available data scraping or other methods — clearly specify process in “Data Collection” section).
- **Analysis engine**: SQL queries enhanced with window functions (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, `AVG() OVER (...)`) to compute moving averages, identify price spikes, detect anomalies and compare item trajectories over time.
- **Output & visualization**: Includes summary tables, trend plots, and CSV exports to highlight pricing dynamics, supported by SQL and optionally additional Python or R scripts to augment insights.
- **Ideal for**: Data analysts, SQL practitioners, or anyone interested in grocer pricing dynamics and how to leverage window functions for time-series data analysis.

##  Why This Project Matters

Understanding the fluctuations in Trader Joe’s prices—even unofficially—can offer practical insights into market behavior, promotional patterns, and consumer-friendly pricing strategies. Window functions enable analysts to uncover nuanced trends like:

- Fast-moving price changes (e.g., promotions or markdowns)
- Rolling average comparisons (week-over-week or month-over-month)
- Item-level trend deviations and volatility
